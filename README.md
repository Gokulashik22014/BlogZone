# BlogZone

    BlogZone is a simple project created using the MERN stack. The website allows the user to post blog and read the blog of other users it works in localhost so yeah all the users are none other than you but the website can be hosted after some fixes which would then perform like a actual website. 
**How to use it**
    1.Clone the repo
    2.Setting up client
      We use React for the frontend along with tailwind to style the website so we need to configure them in order to work
      a.Run "npm install"
      b.Run "npm run dev" to run the server(wait for the server to start first)
    3.Setting up the server
      For the backend we use Express and Node.js, for the database we use Mongodb so we need to set up mongodb account first. Create you MongoDb account, in you cluster create a collection then
      a.Get the URI of the cluster and add it in ".env" file with the name "MONGO_URI"(Note* you need to create the .env file)
      b.Also include your port number in the env file with the name "PORT"
      c.Create a file named uploads in server
      d.Run "npm install"
      e.Run "npm start"
Thanks for taking your time to visit this repo and if you find some issues with the setup please do let me know about it.
I would like to improve my skills as a Full Stack Developer so if you think the code can be improved(it does need lot of improvementsðŸ˜…) please feel free to let me know and thanks in advance.
Happy Coding!!
